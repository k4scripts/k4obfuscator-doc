This is a fair introduction to our project, K4Obfuscator.

### ðŸ”” Security 
It's quite a delicate matter to introduce a new lua obfuscator nowday, as it is likely to be a fork from a past obfuscator. Indeed there were cases in which some "devs" faked to bring a new fresh obfuscator as a paid service.

For this reason we decided to bring what's good from past obfuscation methods and start implementing new features that would make our **free service** unique and updated. 

*We designed this obfuscator as a free obfuscation service to share your scripts. But we surely encourage using paid obfuscators for commercial purposes which require high obfuscation standards*

### Motivation
This is what we mean for "play it straight", main goals behind this project is to bring a free obfuscator for personal usages and at the same time construct a solid and healthy development thanks to an ads key system which allow us to host this service for free!

### Logging scripts
**Absolutly no**, even if this allow malicius scripts to be obfuscated **we don't provide any type of logs** like constants logging etc.
