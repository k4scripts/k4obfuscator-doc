## Obfuscate your first script

Let's prepare a script to obfuscate..
```lua
-- #script.lua
local n = {'a', 'b', 'c'};
local function f()
  local r = '';
  for i=1, #n do
    r = r .. n[math.random(1, #n)];
  end
  return r;
end
print(f());
```

Start obfuscating by running `/obfuscate <key>`.

The bot will prompt you a display with buttons that will help you setup your obfuscation environment:
